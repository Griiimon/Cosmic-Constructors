FIX debug action in property panel instant action press is buggy

FIX wheel spawns without taking suspension orientation into account


property panel group system:
	create group
	add to last group
	group mode toggle: every thing pressed will affect the entire group, including hotkey assignment


ore piles: make it spill items when rotated

items, add mass ( and even dynamic damping? )
throw items: drop with f or when mouse released, but add force on mouse hold duration

player variable jump height ( hold and release )

boulders with scattered stones for first tools
	trees with sticks..

helicopter

fixed rope for carrying objects with heli etc
	use rope visual but 6dof joint

wooden workbench
	
wheelbarrow
	handle bar block: connects with joint, if player in kinematic mode try hybrid controller solution with feedback rigidbody connected to the joint
	fixed wheel block: actual wheel is rigidbody, connected by joint free rolling and high friction

pallet storage block (2x2), that tries to snap and pull on pallets that are on top. unless the pallet has contact with any other grid then the magnetizing is temporarily disabled, so it can be lifted with a forklift etc

split tube groups check if more 1 neighbor when removing and then have the group flood fill for all neighbors, removing any queued neighbor when found within flood fill

FIX fluid splash particles on terrain get stuck, splash position is off

trigger debug action immediately when pressed

grayer color for extra properties in property viewer

check if recent atmospheric shader change has any negative effects in Forward+

WorldItemInstance needs to disable collision shape when on connector or else it will take collision layer of grid and react to raycasts

build crane to lift container
	block groups and hotkeys

plane wings: lift surface block, wing tip block ( improves angular damping in this direction ), flaps block

run damage test with multi blocks in grid

PanelViewer assign hotkeys by pressing 1-9 while selected, 0 to remove
	store in main cockpit

FIX ghost overlays custom shape blocks

update hud display on enter/leave seat

save PeripheralGridEntities ( + connections )

FIX empty grids cause save game corruption?

PanelViewer edit mode: unique, all (same type), mirrored ( which axis? axis aren't even consistent ) => choose&connect mirror block

"thick" wireframe shader for unfinished blocks?

add motion blur ( sphynx addon ) to fluid drops

air ship

add custom lower, upper limit and torque to joint blocks

spring

elevator 

control right-click in tests to remove entire grid

add non solid, frozen rigidbody to player as gravity gauge?

build actual in-game wind-tunnel with ingame colored wind particles blower block
	grids save aero wind direction for all empty surrounding blocks (or wind deflection angle for used ones vs from each cardinal direction )

pick block should copy rotation

braking unsettles suspension too much ( even at low speeds ), maybe its accurate with low damping?

upside down wheels should skip any calculations ( shapecast normal != wheel basis down )

implement rolling resistance

implement per axis linear damping calculated from air resistance profile

fixed airplane wheels ( fixed staticbody low friction colliders with steering logic and impact break chance )
	or wait until rigidbody wheels are implemented

multiplayer grid syncing

custom planet generator

avoid overlap with other grid while building

player carry ore chunks, add collision shape but keep center of mass

BlockInventory component
drill stops drilling when full

sub grid loading and attaching to pistons/rotor

fixed gatling

debug hitpoint bars for each block


BlockPlacementsConditions? => pistons, rotor cant have anything above

BlockInstance on_update() for rotor/piston !?

"F" (hold) click block 
	holding F will trigger UI overlay displaying target blocks default action

build ghost: just make all materials white, no transparency and remove any texture 
	( half transparent shader + texture only solution )


grid angular dampeners

save player only in cryo pod, otherwise use default spawn points or medbay

FIX landing walking on grid triggers left_ground continuously!?
FIX wing collision shapes
FIX getting stuck in terrain when going EVA ( will intersect_shape work against terrain? because Area didnt seem to => JOLT OPT-IN )
FIX removing MultiBlocks can lead to crash ( only when splitting grids? )
FIX when player stands on Grid that gets split at any pos he sometimes gets thrown off
FIX thruster particles are off when rotated=> cant reproduce ( double precision issue?? )
FIX ghost sometimes getting left behind on moving grid
FIX bottom out wheel reverse speed hack => dont show wheel rotation
FIX jetpack counterforce against gravity
FIX static grids connected to terrain jitter ( only when terrain gets edited, lod changes? ) 

IS FIXED?
	FIX sometimes wrong ( downwards ) momentum when strafing off grid 


meta tag for BlockInstance scene sub nodes that should be deleted in ghost ( or just delete anything not MeshInstance3D or plain Node3D ? )



REFACTOR
-------------

all signal and callback functions should start with on_*
check early BlockInstances make sure block_ utility functions like to_global() are used



MULTIPLAYER
---------------

walk speed sync


DESIGN QUESTIONS
-----------------

what about block grids inertia, automatically re-calculated when center of mass or mass changes?

shouldnt all block models face -z? piston and rotor face up

re-center origin of split grids ( to its center of mass )?? needs to snape to Vector3i block pos

how to avoid jetpack collisions causing player to rotate?
	locking axis not really an option since torque is used for turning
	=> use angular_velocity to turn/yaw in integrate_forces and set to 0 for no input

make vehicle wheels rigidbodies with no friction, still use all the calculations but use slider joint for max suspension travel

is there suspension resistance in up direction? if car gets weighed down in the rear shouldnt the front suspension move up?

build mode for periperal entities?
	can be build like block grids
	auto-snap to empty peripheral connectors


SCENARIOS
----------------

Excavator:
	Hinge and Special Connector for Bucket
	Bucket non BlockGrid entity
	bucket has BucketShaped collision for picking up rigidbodies ( ore balls )
	but smaller terrain collision shape so it can move through terrain slightly

	REQUIRES: hinge, 2x2 wheels, non block entities with block connections

Racing:
	track with waypoint lap time detection
	build cars next to track and try to go for fastest lap


Survival (and PVP):
	planet or infinite terrain
	trees rocks etc
	wait for item drops ( at campfire, beacon, random )
	search loot
	enemy drones and robots



NEW MECHANICS
-----------------

Laser Guns
Player Equipment grid like factorio, with shields etc
backpack vs bottles

science, progression unlocking and improving block properties
basic/intermediate/advanced/expert/master sciene levels/recipes

moving celestial bodies by putting each in its own world3d ( not possible in multiplayer currently cuz Voxel plugin will build collision for all voxel terrains at local coords? )

cars: use roguecar components, like engine blocks, steering/brake blocks etc. maybe even do aerodynamic calculations

4 suspension limit game settings: 
	- check all suspension limits and set a global var on the grid (?)
		to cancel out local y velocity with an impulse

	- no travel limit
	- static body limiting
	- suspension block or wheel breaks immediately
	- high exponential counter force/impulse ( depending on grid mass )

only allowed to build peripheral entities ( and even blocks? ) next to 3d printer

special blocks like rails, where you can attach machine entities to like crane or elevator platform, can send signals ( A, B, C ) to those machines to facilitate control from main grid 

radar dish, can pick up near enemies where its facing ( fading hud enemy signals that stay active for 10-30 secs after last pickup )

tiny 25cm grid for drones etc ( zoom option while building? )

can carry fuel can to directly fill tanks a little bit

reward player for staying alive: current player character gets stat boosts for being alive longer ( maybe even for travelling long distances )

skid blocks for making sleds in snow biome

start in "wood age", chopping trees ( drop saplings for replanting ). wood structure block, wooden fixed wheel etc

terrain generator: save heighmap array when lod0 is generated and calc normals and store

ice will have the same friction as all terrain ( wheels can handle it but.. ) grids could change their friction dynamically depending on what terrain type they are making contact with
