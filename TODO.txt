2x1 large thruster
pick block should copy rotation

Video: large flat noise 3d terrain with vehicle
small planet (atmosphere) with asteroid and drill ship and fading gravity

hand tool is not aligned
3rd person model hand tool must be hidden



multiplayer grid syncing

put tool in players hand in 3rd person

custom planet generator

jetpack counterforce against gravity

avoid overlap with other grid while building

player carry ore chunks, add collision shape but keep center of mass

BlockInventory component
drill stops drilling when full

sub grid loading and attaching to pistons/rotor

fixed gatling

debug hitpoint bars for each block


BlockPlacementsConditions? => pistons, rotor cant have anything above

BlockInstance on_update() for rotor/piston !?

"F" (hold) click block 
	holding F will trigger UI overlay displaying target blocks default action

build ghost: just make all materials white, no transparency and remove any texture 
	( half transparent shader + texture only solution )

Alt fps look around while fixed

grid angular dampeners

save player only in cryo pod, otherwise use default spawn points or medbay

FIX getting stuck in terrain when going EVA ( will intersect_shape work against terrain? because Area didnt seem to => JOLT OPT-IN )
FIX inital grid align when sloped/diagonal initial normal
FIX sometimes wrong ( downwards ) momentum when strafing off grid 
FIX removing MultiBlocks can lead to crash ( only when splitting grids? )
FIX when player stands on Grid that gets split at any pos he sometimes gets thrown off
FIX thruster particles are off when rotated=> cant reproduce


meta tag for BlockInstance scene sub nodes that should be deleted in ghost ( or just delete anything not MeshInstance3D or plain Node3D ? )


DEMO VIDEO
---------------


build car on planet with piston+rotor+drills
	planet size * 4
shoot car with rocket
	explosion effect visually + force
build space ship on planet
	release landing gear
fly towards asteroid
	skybox transition
drill into asteroid



MULTIPLAYER
---------------

walk speed sync


DESIGN QUESTIONS
-----------------

what about block grids inertia, automatically re-calculated when center of mass or mass changes?

shouldnt all block models face -z? piston and rotor face up

re-center origin of split grids ( to its center of mass )?? needs to snape to Vector3i block pos

how to avoid jetpack collisions causing player to rotate?
	locking axis not really an option since torque is used for turning
	=> use angular_velocity to turn/yaw in integrate_forces and set to 0 for no input


NEW MECHANICS
-----------------

Laser Guns
Player Equipment grid like factorio, with shields etc
backpack vs bottles

science, progression unlocking and improving block properties
basic/intermediate/advanced/expert/master sciene levels/recipes

moving celestial bodies by putting each in its own world3d

cars: use roguecar components, like engine blocks, steering/brake blocks etc. maybe even do aerodynamic calculations

4 suspension limit game settings: 
	- check all suspension limits and set a global var on the grid (?)
		to cancel out local y velocity with an impulse

	- no travel limit
	- static body limiting
	- suspension block or wheel breaks immediately
	- high exponential counter force/impulse ( depending on grid mass )
