rotator block use grid_block rotation, dont assume y = up

Piston

asteroid ore materials

wrap block instance vars into BlockPropBool, BlockPropFloat

Alt fps look around while fixed

grid angular dampeners

delete block ( flood fill to detect if grid was split )

fixed gatling, damage blocks + impact impulse

multi blocks

FIX getting stuck in terrain when going EVA ( will intersect_shape work against terrain? because Area didnt seem to => JOLT OPT-IN )
FIX inital grid align when sloped/diagonal initial normal
FIX sometimes wrong ( downwards ) momentum when strafing off grid 
FIX shouldnt all blocks face forward by default ( piston and rotor are facing up rn )

meta tag for BlockInstance scene sub nodes that should be deleted in ghost ( or just delete anything not MeshInstance3D or plain Node3D ? )


NEW MECHANICS

Laser Guns
Player Equipment grid like factorio, with shields etc
backpack vs bottles
