sub grid loading and attaching to pistons/rotor

use voxel stream

account for voxelterrain scaling in mining methods and asteroid generation code 

BlockPlacementsConditions

"F" (hold) click block 
	holding F will trigger UI overlay displaying target blocks default action

add hand item viewport
	rocket launcher
	hand drill

make build ghost half transparent

Alt fps look around while fixed

grid angular dampeners

remove grid if all blocks are removed
flood fill to detect if grid was split on remove block

fixed gatling, damage blocks + impact impulse

save player only in cryo pod, otherwise use default spawn points or medbay

FIX getting stuck in terrain when going EVA ( will intersect_shape work against terrain? because Area didnt seem to => JOLT OPT-IN )
FIX inital grid align when sloped/diagonal initial normal
FIX sometimes wrong ( downwards ) momentum when strafing off grid 
FIX shouldnt all blocks face forward by default ( piston and rotor are facing up rn )

meta tag for BlockInstance scene sub nodes that should be deleted in ghost ( or just delete anything not MeshInstance3D or plain Node3D ? )

what about block grids inertia??


NEW MECHANICS

Laser Guns
Player Equipment grid like factorio, with shields etc
backpack vs bottles

science, progression unlocking and improving block properties
basic/intermediate/advanced/expert/master sciene levels/recipes
