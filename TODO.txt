test rotor with 2 clients

FIX property viewer not working on MultiBlock => interact_with_block signal receiver expects GridBlock, signal sends BaseGridBlock. convert before sending?
FIX block splitting still wonky. only with anchored? only in multiplayer! split anchored grids stay frozen on client => only run unfreeze check on server and then sync 
FIX thruster particles on client
FIX spawning rotor on client doesnt spawn head
FIX removing multiblock, sync state expects GridBlock


network sync plane_fill and blueprint spawning

sync extra block properties ( only while visible on client, viewer panel etc? )

send requested movement to server ( for keys that are held it should be the events when pressed and then released as "reliable" )

vehicle wheel need to work on grids

desync test: hash all grid ids + blocks.size() and compare to server

test peer disconnection from server. may not need any handling


block splitting new grid ids need to be synced => build a list of all split grids, this list has the same grid pointers in same order. so the server can send an approriate update using the list indices and the previous grid id of the original grid

FIX non-force-offset thrusters should apply force not at center but calculated CoM
FIX when interval updating property viewer only update extra properties 

ore pile nomral map array + metallic and roughness value per raw material

keep available keys + short desc in a dictionary per action state for quick help

on_grid_changed() in BlockInstance callback if grid split results in new grid. mostly for joint reparenting 

network grid syncing

thrusters particle TARGET direction seems to be in global coords

Components can_* functions just use Callable refs like with FluidConsumer


add debug console plugin

tree spawner

wooden workbench

ore piles: make it spill items when rotated

load blueprints: use half transparent boxes per grid block )

save physical/world items

transfer block_types when splitting grids


property panel group system:
	create group
	add to last group
	group mode toggle: every thing pressed will affect the entire group, including hotkey assignment

suspension props
	power
	brakes
	spring

plane fill: flood fill plane without placing blocks ( set a max cap ) and only if contained plane is found spawn blocks

when the car isnt moving ( for a bit? ) put an additional damping factor on the suspension

terrain height map array store and calc normals:
Chunks of height info are created independent of the terrain generator, but terrain generator ( can look if height map for current chunk has been created - HOW TO MATCH WEIRD 19x19 voxel chunks) queries height from that cache which will either return a cached value or call get_height() if cache doesn't exist yet

Ore Intake: Ore Funnel, takes ore from above one-by-one and ejects below to valid target 

Fluid Consumer: make sure correct fluid is supplied


items, add mass ( and even dynamic damping? )

serializable inventories

throw items: drop with f or when mouse released, but add force on mouse hold duration

higher default damping on suspension, hard code?

when splitting
	prioritize: with more functional blocks, with more blocks
	trigger on_grid_changed()
	reconnect signals from BlockInstances


paraglider control with "strapped-in seat": can apply minimal torque to the grid, but no hotbar. only deliver maximum torque if seat is a CoM?

sucker block: sucks world items up and keeps them sucked while active. use shapecasts to avoid sucking another one while there is one sucked in 

propeller/fans: like low force thrusters ( with built-in rotation capabilities? )

can i rotate a subgrid on a rotor by pulling on handles?
	lock mode for rotor, rails: motor 0 velocity means locked or free

use calc_angular_velocity() in periperal connector code

only add ore to pile if it can take all of it ( or consume and spit out the overflow as new item )

in addition to BlockPlacementCondition also have BlockDockConditions for neighbors to override placement

adaptive physics ticks per second ( needs to be multiple of 60 and on server only to properly sync with client? ) 


player variable jump height ( hold and release )

boulders with scattered stones for first tools
	trees with sticks..

helicopter

fixed rope for carrying objects with heli etc
	use rope visual but 6dof joint


split tube groups check if more 1 neighbor when removing and then have the group flood fill for all neighbors, removing any queued neighbor when found within flood fill

grayer color for extra properties in property viewer

check if recent atmospheric shader change has any negative effects in Forward+



plane wings: 
	lift surface block
	wing tip block ( improves angular damping in this direction )
	flaps block

run damage test with multi blocks in grid


save PeripheralGridEntities ( + connections )

PanelViewer edit mode: unique, all (same type), mirrored ( which axis? axis aren't even consistent ) => choose&connect mirror block

"thick" wireframe shader for unfinished blocks?

add motion blur ( sphynx addon? ) to fluid drops
 or just make them a little transparent and each drop has a trail of 5 - 10 drop meshes that will be destroyed at the same position where the original drop was destroyed

air ship

add custom lower, upper limit and torque to joint blocks

spring

add non solid, frozen rigidbody to player as gravity gauge?

build actual in-game wind-tunnel with ingame colored wind particles blower block
	grids save aero wind direction for all empty surrounding blocks (or wind deflection angle for used ones vs from each cardinal direction )

braking unsettles suspension too much ( even at low speeds ), maybe its accurate with low damping?

upside down wheels should skip any calculations ( shapecast normal != wheel basis down )

implement rolling resistance

implement per axis linear damping calculated from air resistance profile

avoid overlap with other grid while building

player carry ore chunks, add collision shape but keep center of mass

BlockInventory component
drill stops drilling when full

fixed gatling

debug hitpoint bars for each block


BlockPlacementsConditions? => pistons, rotor cant have anything above

BlockInstance on_update() for rotor/piston !?

"F" (hold) click block 
	holding F will trigger UI overlay displaying target blocks default action

build ghost: just make all materials white, no transparency and remove any texture 
	( half transparent shader + texture only solution )


grid angular dampeners

save player only in cryo pod, otherwise use default spawn points or medbay

FIX landing walking on grid triggers left_ground continuously!?
FIX getting stuck in terrain when going EVA ( will intersect_shape work against terrain? because Area didnt seem to => JOLT OPT-IN )
FIX removing MultiBlocks can lead to crash ( only when splitting grids? )
FIX when player stands on Grid that gets split at any pos he sometimes gets thrown off
FIX thruster particles are off when rotated=> cant reproduce ( double precision issue?? )
FIX ghost sometimes getting left behind on moving grid
FIX bottom out wheel reverse speed hack => dont show wheel rotation
FIX jetpack counterforce against gravity
FIX static grids connected to terrain jitter ( only when terrain gets edited, lod changes? ) 
FIX grabbing handles on same grid player is standing on should have no effect. ALSO if grid is connected to grid players standing on
FIX grabbing handles weight calculation for all connected grids => make grabbing joint-based
FIX suspension jitter with joints
FIX build block placement after placing custom shape 
INVESTIGATE possible to pick up item from floor and from OreContainer with one F push in the same frame. almost seemed so


IS FIXED?
	FIX sometimes wrong ( downwards ) momentum when strafing off grid 
	FIX ghost overlays custom shape blocks
	FIX empty grids cause save game corruption?




REFACTOR
-------------

all signal and callback functions should start with on_*
check early BlockInstances make sure block_ utility functions like to_global() are used



MULTIPLAYER
---------------

walk speed sync


DESIGN QUESTIONS
-----------------

what about block grids inertia, automatically re-calculated when center of mass or mass changes?

shouldnt all block models face -z? piston and rotor face up

re-center origin of split grids ( to its center of mass )?? needs to snap to Vector3i block pos and update all relative positions

make vehicle wheels rigidbodies with no friction, still use all the calculations but use slider joint for max suspension travel

is there suspension resistance in up direction? if car gets weighed down in the rear shouldnt the front suspension move up?

build mode for periperal entities: auto-snap to empty peripheral connectors?

handle grabbing with joint and motor instead of velocity and torque?

NEW MECHANICS
-----------------

Laser Guns
Player Equipment grid like factorio, with shields etc
backpack vs bottles

science, progression unlocking and improving block properties
basic/intermediate/advanced/expert/master sciene levels/recipes

moving celestial bodies by putting each in its own world3d ( not possible in multiplayer currently cuz Voxel plugin will build collision for all voxel terrains at local coords? )

only allowed to build peripheral entities next to 3d printer

grids can send signals ( A, B, C ) to subgrids to facilitate control from main grid 

radar dish, can pick up near enemies where its facing ( fading hud enemy signals that stay active for 10-30 secs after last pickup )

tiny 25cm grid for drones etc ( zoom option while building? )

can carry fuel can to directly fill tanks a little bit

reward player for staying alive: current player character gets stat boosts for being alive longer ( maybe even for travelling long distances )

skid blocks for making sleds in snow biome

start in "wood age", chopping trees ( drop saplings for replanting ). wood structure block, wooden fixed wheel etc

ice will have the same friction as all terrain ( wheels can handle it but.. ) grids could change their friction dynamically depending on what terrain type they are making contact with
