gravity jetpack ( equipment slot )

avoid overlap with other grid while building

limit camera rotation

re-center origin of split grids ( to its center of mass? )

test world with small 1m chunk planet, real gravity and asteroid
	=> skybox transition?

player carry ore chunks, add collision shape but keep center of mass

BlockInventory component
drill stops drilling when full

rocket projectile thruster flicker 

when splitting static grid recalculate for each part if still/newly static
	run ground check for each block, or store "anchored" state in GridBlock
	..or even better in grid via dictionary so GridBlock doesnt get bloated

sub grid loading and attaching to pistons/rotor

fixed gatling

debug hitpoint bars for each block

damage impact impulse
	applies force at the impact position => BlockGrid.apply_kinetic_impulse()
	if explosion trigger the explosion Area detection plus explosion force deferred, so game has time to potentially split grids
	=> World.apply_explosion_force()

BlockPlacementsConditions? => pistons, rotor cant have anything above

BlockInstance on_update() for rotor/piston !?

"F" (hold) click block 
	holding F will trigger UI overlay displaying target blocks default action

build ghost: just make all materials white, no transparency and remove any texture 
	( half transparent shader + texture only solution )

Alt fps look around while fixed

grid angular dampeners

save player only in cryo pod, otherwise use default spawn points or medbay

FIX getting stuck in terrain when going EVA ( will intersect_shape work against terrain? because Area didnt seem to => JOLT OPT-IN )
FIX inital grid align when sloped/diagonal initial normal
FIX sometimes wrong ( downwards ) momentum when strafing off grid 
FIX removing MultiBlocks can lead to crash ( only when splitting grids? )

meta tag for BlockInstance scene sub nodes that should be deleted in ghost ( or just delete anything not MeshInstance3D or plain Node3D ? )


DEMO VIDEO
---------------

distance adjust 3rd person cam
model arms low when not eva (forward) / jump(side)

build car on planet
	atmospheric jetpack
shoot car with rocket
	explosion effect visually + force
build space ship on planet
	release landing gear
fly towards asteroid
	skybox transition
drill into asteroid



MULTIPLAYER
---------------

walk animation


DESIGN QUESTIONS
-----------------

what about block grids inertia, automatically re-calculated when center of mass or mass changes?
shouldnt all block models face -z? piston and rotor face up


NEW MECHANICS
-----------------

Laser Guns
Player Equipment grid like factorio, with shields etc
backpack vs bottles

science, progression unlocking and improving block properties
basic/intermediate/advanced/expert/master sciene levels/recipes

moving celestial bodies by putting each in its own world3d

cars: use roguecar components, like engine blocks, steering/brake blocks etc. maybe even do aerodynamic calculations

4 suspension limit game settings: 
	- check all suspension limits and set a global var on the grid (?)
		to cancel out local y velocity with an impulse

	- no travel limit
	- static body limiting
	- suspension block or wheel breaks immediately
	- high exponential counter force/impulse ( depending on grid mass )
