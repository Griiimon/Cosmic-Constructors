retain correct rotation and momentum when switching to EVA

use different floor shape cast on terrain?

3rd person cam

jetpack turn off dampers

longer magnetic boots activation shapecast to avoid colliding with grid first. then snap to grid

rotator block use grid_block rotation, dont assume y = up

asteroid ore materials

wrap block instance vars into BlockPropBool, BlockPropFloat

Alt fps look around while fixed

grid angular dampeners

delete block ( flood fill to detect if grid was split )

fixed gatling, damage blocks + impact impulse

multi blocks

FIX getting stuck in terrain when going EVA ( will intersect_shape work against terrain? because Area didnt seem to => JOLT OPT-IN )

meta tag for BlockInstance scene sub nodes that should be deleted in ghost ( or just delete anything not MeshInstance3D or plain Node3D ? )
