block interaction SHAPEcast piercing non functional blocks

try more joint solver iterations

update hud display on enter/leave seat

save PeripheralGridEntities ( + connections )

FIX empty grids cause save game corruption?

PanelViewer edit mode: unique, all (same type), mirrored ( which axis? axis aren't even consistent ) => choose&connect mirror block

"thick" wireframe shader for unfinished blocks?

air ship

add custom lower, upper limit and torque to joint blocks

spring

conveyor

elevator 

control right-click in tests to remove entire grid

add non solid, frozen rigidbody to player as gravity gauge?


pick block should copy rotation

braking unsettles suspension too much ( even at low speeds ), maybe its accurate with low damping?

upside down wheels should skip any calculations ( shapecast normal != wheel basis down )

implement rolling resistance

implement per axis linear damping calculated from air resistance profile

fixed airplane wheels ( fixed staticbody low friction colliders with steering logic and impact break chance )
	or wait until rigidbody wheels are implemented

multiplayer grid syncing

custom planet generator

avoid overlap with other grid while building

player carry ore chunks, add collision shape but keep center of mass

BlockInventory component
drill stops drilling when full

sub grid loading and attaching to pistons/rotor

fixed gatling

debug hitpoint bars for each block


BlockPlacementsConditions? => pistons, rotor cant have anything above

BlockInstance on_update() for rotor/piston !?

"F" (hold) click block 
	holding F will trigger UI overlay displaying target blocks default action

build ghost: just make all materials white, no transparency and remove any texture 
	( half transparent shader + texture only solution )


grid angular dampeners

save player only in cryo pod, otherwise use default spawn points or medbay

FIX landing walking on grid triggers left_ground continuously!?
FIX wing collision shapes
FIX getting stuck in terrain when going EVA ( will intersect_shape work against terrain? because Area didnt seem to => JOLT OPT-IN )
FIX removing MultiBlocks can lead to crash ( only when splitting grids? )
FIX when player stands on Grid that gets split at any pos he sometimes gets thrown off
FIX thruster particles are off when rotated=> cant reproduce ( double precision issue?? )
FIX ghost sometimes getting left behind on moving grid
FIX bottom out wheel reverse speed hack => dont show wheel rotation
FIX jetpack counterforce against gravity
FIX smooth block rotation starts to fail at a certain point ( euler lock? )

IS FIXED?
	FIX sometimes wrong ( downwards ) momentum when strafing off grid 


meta tag for BlockInstance scene sub nodes that should be deleted in ghost ( or just delete anything not MeshInstance3D or plain Node3D ? )




MULTIPLAYER
---------------

walk speed sync


DESIGN QUESTIONS
-----------------

what about block grids inertia, automatically re-calculated when center of mass or mass changes?

shouldnt all block models face -z? piston and rotor face up

re-center origin of split grids ( to its center of mass )?? needs to snape to Vector3i block pos

how to avoid jetpack collisions causing player to rotate?
	locking axis not really an option since torque is used for turning
	=> use angular_velocity to turn/yaw in integrate_forces and set to 0 for no input

make vehicle wheels rigidbodies with no friction, still use all the calculations but use slider joint for max suspension travel

is there suspension resistance in up direction? if car gets weighed down in the rear shouldnt the front suspension move up?

build mode for periperal entities?
	can be build like block grids
	auto-snap to empty peripheral connectors


SCENARIOS
----------------

Excavator:
	Hinge and Special Connector for Bucket
	Bucket non BlockGrid entity
	bucket has BucketShaped collision for picking up rigidbodies ( ore balls )
	but smaller terrain collision shape so it can move through terrain slightly

	REQUIRES: hinge, 2x2 wheels, non block entities with block connections

Racing:
	track with waypoint lap time detection
	build cars next to track and try to go for fastest lap


Survival (and PVP):
	planet or infinite terrain
	trees rocks etc
	wait for item drops ( at campfire, beacon, random )
	search loot
	enemy drones and robots



NEW MECHANICS
-----------------

Laser Guns
Player Equipment grid like factorio, with shields etc
backpack vs bottles

science, progression unlocking and improving block properties
basic/intermediate/advanced/expert/master sciene levels/recipes

moving celestial bodies by putting each in its own world3d

cars: use roguecar components, like engine blocks, steering/brake blocks etc. maybe even do aerodynamic calculations

4 suspension limit game settings: 
	- check all suspension limits and set a global var on the grid (?)
		to cancel out local y velocity with an impulse

	- no travel limit
	- static body limiting
	- suspension block or wheel breaks immediately
	- high exponential counter force/impulse ( depending on grid mass )
